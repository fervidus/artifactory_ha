## Overview

This ONLY install Artifactory HA.

If you are looking for the regulare commercial installation, or OSS, look at:

Artifactory OSS: https://forge.puppet.com/fervid/artifactory

Artifactory PRO: https://forge.puppet.com/fervid/artifactory_pro

Github and gitlab are great for storing source control, but bad at storing installers and compiled packages.

This is where Artifactory comes in. It stores all of your organizations artifacts in an organized and secure manner.

## Module Description

The Artifactory HA module installs, configures, and manages the Artifactory pro binary repository.

The Artifactory HA module manages both the installation and database configuration of Artifactory Pro.

## Setup

### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**

Requires a JDK to be installed.

### Beginning with artifactory

Artifactory ha requires a license key, cluster configurations and nfs location information.

~~~
class { '::artifactory_ha':
  license_key                    => 'abc123',
  jdbc_driver_url                => 'puppet://modules/my_module/mysql.jar',
  db_type                        => 'oracle',
  db_url                         => 'jdbc:oracle:thin:@somedomain.com:1521:arti001',
  db_username                    => 'my_username',
  db_password                    => 'efw23gn2j3',
  security_token                => 'ABC1MY0Token1',
  is_primary                    => true,
  cluster_home                  => '/nfs/mount/location',
  binary_provider_type           => 'filesystem',
  pool_max_active                => 100,
  pool_max_idle                  => 10,
  binary_provider_cache_maxSize  => $binary_provider_cache_maxSize,
  binary_provider_filesystem_dir => '/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/data/filestore',
  binary_provider_cache_dir      => '/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/',
}
~~~

## Usage

All interaction for the server is done via `::artifactory_pro`.

## Reference

### Classes

#### Public classes

* [`artifactory`](#artifactoryserver): Installs and configures Artifactory.

#### Private classes

* `artifactory_ha::config`: Configures Artifactory Pro.
* `artifactory_ha::post_config`: Does pro post configuration.

### Defines

#### Public defines

* `artifactory_ha::plugin`: Adds a groovy plugin to the server

### Parameters

#### artifactory

##### `license_key`

Sets the name of the Artifactory license key'.

This is required.

##### `yum_name`

Sets the name of the yum repository. Defaults to 'bintray-jfrog-artifactory-pro-rpms'.

This can be changed if Artifactory needs to be setup from a different repository. Typically this is done if an organization has a 'trusted' yum repo.

##### `yum_baseurl`

Sets the base url of the yum repository to name. Defaults to 'http://jfrog.bintray.com/artifactory-pro-rpms'.

This can be changed if Artifactory needs to be setup from a different repository. Typically this is done if an organization has a 'trusted' yum repo.

##### `package_name`

Sets the package name to install. Defaults to 'jfrog-artifactory-pro'.

This can be changed if Artifactory needs to install a differently named package. Possibly needed if an organization creates their own Artifactory package.

##### `manage_java`

Tells the module whether or not to manage the java class. This defaults to true. Usually this is what you want.

If your organization actively manages the java installs across your environment set this to false.

##### `manage_repo`

Tells the module whether or not to manage the Artifactory YUM repository. This defaults to true.

If Artifactory YUM repository is already managed set this to false.

##### `jdbc_driver_url`

Sets the location for the jdbc driver. Uses the wget module to retrieve the driver.

This is required if using a new data source.

##### `db_type`

The type of database to configure for. Valid values are 'mariadb', 'mssql', 'mysql', 'oracle', 'postgresql'.

##### `db_hostname`

The hostname of the database.

##### `db_port`

The port of the database.

##### `db_username`

The username for the database account.

##### `db_password`

The password for the database account.

##### `security_token`

Security token that is unique among all the members of this cluster.

##### `is_primary`

True or false. There must be one primary per cluster. All other cluster nodes shold be false.

##### `cluster_home`

The NFS clust home directory.

##### `binary_provider_type`

Optional setting for the binary storage provider. The type of database to configure for. Valid values are 'filesystem', 'fullDb', 'cachedFS', 'S3'. Defaults to 'filesystem'.

###### filesystem (default)
This means that metadata is stored in the database, but binaries are stored in the file system. The default location is under $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/data/filestore however this can be modified.

###### fullDb
All the metadata and the binaries are stored as BLOBs in the database.

###### cachedFS
Works the same way as filesystem but also has a binary LRU (Least Recently Used) cache for upload/download requests. Improves performance of instances with high IOPS (I/O Operations) or slow NFS access.

###### S3
This is the setting used for S3 Object Storage.

##### `pool_max_active`

Optional setting for the maximum number of pooled database connections. Defaults to 100.

##### `pool_max_idle`

Optional setting for the maximum number of pooled idle database connections Defaults to 10.

##### `binary_provider_cache_maxSize`

Optional setting for the maximum cache size. This value specifies the maximum cache size (in bytes) to allocate on the system for caching BLOBs.

##### `binary_provider_filesystem_dir`

Optional setting for the artifactory filestore location. The binary.provider.type is set to filesystem this value specifies the location of the binaries. Defaults to '$ARTIFACTORY_HOME/data/filestore'.

##### `binary_provider_cache_dir`

Optional setting for the location of the cache. This should be set to your $ARTIFACTORY_HOME directory directly (not on the NFS).

#### artifactory::plugin

##### `url`

The url to the location of the groovy file.
